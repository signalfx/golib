# golib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/signalfx/golib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/signalfx/golib)

Various golang libraries we've found useful. The SignalFx client library (SDK) for Go is available [here](https://github.com/signalfx/golib/tree/master/sfxclient) along with instructions for installing the library and using the included functions.

## Go modules
If your project uses Go modules, you need to refer to this project as
`github.com/signalfx/golib/v3` in your imports.  If your project is not using
modules, you might not be able to use this library after v3.0.0.

## Dependencies

Please note that there is a dependency on Thrift v0.9.3 for some of the libraries in this repository.
